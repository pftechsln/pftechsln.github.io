This is a proof of concept app to use the SMART on FHIR APIs to retrieve patients health data from their EHR system. 

This app currently only contains the front end client built with HTML/Bootstrap/Angular. It does not have a back end server yet. Any patient EHR data retrieved will not be stored anywhere on the server.
